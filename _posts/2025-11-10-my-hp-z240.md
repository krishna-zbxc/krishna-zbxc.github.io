Hey everyone — sorry for not posting in a while 😅.  
It’s been a long week full of cables, drives, BIOS menus, and the occasional *“why isn’t this booting?”* moment.  
But let’s rewind to the start.

## 🛒 The Tori Find

A few days ago, I found an **HP Z240 Office PC** on Tori for just **€120**.  
Specs looked great for the price:

- Intel **Xeon E3-1245** (4 cores / 8 threads)  
- **16 GB ECC DDR4 @ 2133 MHz**  
- **480 GB SSD + 500 GB HDD**  
- NVIDIA **NVS 510** GPU (4 × Mini DisplayPort)  
- Windows 10 Pro freshly installed

It looked like a perfect starting point — strong enough for small AI models, light gaming, and some tinkering.

## 🧰 First Steps: Setting Up

I brought the Z240 home, gave it a quick dust-off, and connected everything.  
The machine booted like a champ into Windows 10 Pro.  
But, as expected, it didn’t support Windows 11 officially — no TPM 2.0, no Secure Boot.  
That didn’t stop me, of course.

Using a few registry tweaks (`LabConfig` keys), I bypassed those checks and launched the Windows 11 setup.  
It worked — until I ran into the usual edition mismatch and language issues.  
More on that later.

## 💾 The Drive Adventure

Now, here’s where things got interesting.  
I had a **Synology DS220j NAS**, and I decided to *borrow* (okay, “steal” 😅) one of its SSDs to use in the workstation.  
I powered everything off properly and installed the drive in the Z240.

Windows detected the SSD instantly, but — of course — it wouldn’t mount it.  
The reason? Synology formats drives using Linux filesystems and RAID structures.

Disk Management showed it as a **Linux RAID** volume.  
So Windows could see the drive, but not open it.

## 🔍 Figuring Out the Format

After a bit of detective work (and a few hours in forums), I realized that Synology uses **ext4 or btrfs** filesystems wrapped in **mdadm RAID**.  
That meant the only way to read it in Windows was to use specialized tools.

I tested a few:

- **DiskInternals Linux Reader** (free – read-only – worked perfectly)
- **DiskGenius** (free, more technical)
- **UFS Explorer** (powerful but paid)

Linux Reader won. Within minutes, I could see all my old Synology folders and files again — safely, without formatting anything.

## ⚡ Lessons Learned

- Always double-check what filesystem your NAS uses before removing drives.  
- Linux RAID isn’t scary, but Windows doesn’t understand it without help.  
- Never “initialize” a disk in Windows if you care about the data — that wipes it.  
- For future reuse, I’ll probably reformat that SSD as **exFAT** so both Windows and Linux can use it seamlessly.

## 🧠 Where I Left Off

At this point, everything was working:  
Windows 10 Pro → Windows 11 setup bypass ready ✅  
Synology SSD connected and readable ✅  
All tools tested ✅  

…and then the **boot issue** started 😅  
Right after finishing with the drives, the system began cycling through boot devices — but that’s a story for the next post.

Stay tuned for **Part 2**, where I dive into fixing the bootloader and (hopefully) getting back into Windows 11 without losing a single byte.

*Thanks for reading, and again — sorry for the long silence!*  
Between new hardware, registry edits, and RAID partitions, it’s been a bit of a ride.
